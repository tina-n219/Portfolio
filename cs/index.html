	<h1> Freecell </h1>
	<p>The primary goal of this assignment is to practice implementing an interface based on given specifications, and by choosing an appropriate data representation that helps in providing the functionality promised by the interface.
	</p>

	<p>While the model in a program represents the game state, the controller “runs” the program, effectively facilitating it through a sequence of operations. You will follow the same "interface-implementation" method of creating the controller</p>

	<h1>Easy Animator </h1>
	<h3>Model-View-Controller Architecture</h3>

	<p>We will build an application that helps to create simple but effective 2D animations from shapes (such as the above examples). One of our main goals will be to create a separation between how an algorithm or phenomenon is described and how it is drawn on the screen. This separation will allow us to create an application that will draw an animation according to how it is described in text, without being tied to how the description was produced.
	</p>

	<br>

	<p>The command-line arguments will be of the form<br>
	<-if name-of-animation-file> <br><-iv type-of-view> <br><-o where-output-show-go> <br><-speed integer-ticks-per-second>
	</p>

	<br>

	<h3>Four views for your Easy Animator application:
		<hr><br>
	</h3>

	<h4> Textual </h4>
	<p>This view will show a textual description of the animation.</p>
	<div class="image-container">
		<img src="images/EasyAnim/TextView.png" width="450" height="200">
	</div>
	<br>

	<h4>SVG</h4>
	<p>In this view, you will produce a textual description of the animation that is compliant with the SVG file format. The output of the program is saved in a file, and can be directly viewed in a web browser.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Visual</h4>
	<p>Implemented with JavaSwing</p>
	<div class="image-container">
		<img src="images/EasyAnim/VisualView.png"
		width="1440" height="900">
	</div>
	<br>

	<h4>Hybrid</h4>
	<p>This view will have capabilities of the visual view, in that it will actually show the animation being played. It will also have capabilities of the SVG view, in that it will be able to create and export the animation in SVG format.</p><br>
	<p>This application also supports the following functionality:</p><br>
